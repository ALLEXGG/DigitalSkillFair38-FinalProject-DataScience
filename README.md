🚢 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a fundamental step in the data science workflow. It involves summarizing and visualizing the key characteristics of a dataset to gain meaningful insights. For this project, I performed EDA on the Titanic dataset—a well-known dataset often used in data science learning environments.

The dataset used was provided by the bootcamp platform @dibimbing.id. However, similar versions of this dataset are publicly available on platforms like Kaggle. It contains demographic and survival information of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic.

You can access the dataset I used through my GitHub repository (link above), or feel free to explore and download a fresh copy via Kaggle.

⚙️ Context & Purpose
The maritime transport industry—especially large passenger vessels like the Titanic—has played a crucial role in human migration. This analysis aims to better understand survival patterns, passenger characteristics, and potential factors affecting one's likelihood of survival during maritime disasters.

🎯 Objectives of the Analysis
The main goals of this EDA are as follows:

To analyze the age distribution of passengers.

To compare the gender ratio on board.

To assess survival rates by gender.

To explore the relationship between age and survival.

To visualize findings in the form of clear and informative plots.

🔍 Key Insights
a. Gender and Survival:

Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than male passengers.

This suggests that the "women and children first" protocol was likely applied during evacuation efforts.

b. Age and Survival:

Children had a better chance of survival compared to other age groups.

The average age of survivors was slightly lower than that of non-survivors.

c. Overall Observations:

Women and children emerged as the most protected demographic in this tragedy.

Adult men, especially those in working-age groups, were the most likely not to survive.

💡 Recommendations & Implications
Disaster evacuation planning should continue to prioritize women and children, as this strategy has shown to be effective.

Basic demographic factors like age and gender can offer powerful predictive insights in emergency scenarios.

Even limited datasets can yield valuable conclusions when analyzed correctly and thoughtfully.
